Django @Ovid@ -- A Django project created by Django Layout.
===

Django @Ovid@ is...

## BUILD

This runs `python setup.py develop` (more or less).

    ./build.sh

    # Create a dummy SSL certificate.
    ./bin/make-ssl-cert.sh

    ./bin/lighttpd.sh start
    sensible-browser http://localhost:8080
    ./bin/lighttpd.sh stop

To use the admin site, run (only once):

    ./bin/django-manage.sh createsuperuser

Then, later on, each time a model changes run:

    ./bin/django-migrate.sh

## TEST

This uses `nosetests` to run the unit tests, and enables the built-in
coverage report.

    ./tests.sh
    sensible-browser ./coverage/index.html

## INSTALL

There is nothing to install.

## DEBUG

The layout used by Django @Ovid@ depends on that a particular
environment has been setup (see `etc/common`). For this reason several
wrapper scripts have been provided to help when working on the
command-line. For example:

    $ ./bin/python.sh
    >>>
